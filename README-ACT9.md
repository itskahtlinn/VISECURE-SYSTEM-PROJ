2. Revision of About Us Page UI Design
   
//Ongoing Progress - We are actively engaged in learning and implementing the React framework for our project and to enhance the database functionality of our application, we are exploring and integrating Caspio. 

//Issues and Concern - So far, we're happy to share that there are no major issues with the project. The team is working well together, making progress on our development goals. 
However, we have a concern with one of our member, Mr. Dacillo, who hasn't been fully involved or contributing to all group activities. We have tried to reach out to him, 
but he is consistently missing in action and not responding to our messages.
