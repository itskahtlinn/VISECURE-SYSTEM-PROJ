***Activity 6***

--In Activity 6, we initiated the development of our project using Visual Studio Code, focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the foundation for the Visecure application. The primary components established in this phase include:

// Visecure Main (Landing Page): The main landing page serves as the initial interface for users visiting the Visecure application. It provides a welcoming and informative introduction to the platform.

-Image Slider Implementation: An image slider has been integrated into the landing page to enhance visual appeal and engagement. This dynamic component showcases multiple images, contributing to a more interactive and visually appealing user experience.
-Header and Footer: A header and footer have been added to the landing page for consistent navigation and branding. The header includes essential links and navigation elements, while the footer provides additional information and links.
-Scrolling Effect:JavaScript has been implemented for a scrolling effect. A "Scroll Down to See More" text will only appear in the first section of the landing page. As users scroll down, the text disappears, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience.
-Buttons (Functional): This will be rediring to AdminPage and UserPage Login.

//Visecure Admin Log In: We implemented the admin login functionality, creating a secure access point for administrators to manage and control the system.
-Buttons (Currently Non-functional): The admin login section includes buttons for interaction. However, it's important to note that these buttons are currently non-functional.

//Visecure User Log In: The user login feature was integrated, allowing registered users to access their accounts and utilize the various services offered by Visecure.
-Buttons (Currently Non-functional): Similar to the admin login section, the user login features buttons that are currently non-functional. These buttons will be implemented in subsequent development stages.
