        <h1> THE TEAM BEHIND SMOOTHMOVES, INC. </h1>
        <p>
            We firmly believe that for an organization to progress and ultimately achieve its success, 
            it must be directed to achieve and realize its essence of existence.
            </br>
            Many enterprises bring in new ideas, products and services.
            </br>
            Thus, having the right people for the right job is sufficient. 
            However, we also believe that providing the best deserves no less than the best 
            and quality should not be compromised with quantity.
            </br>
